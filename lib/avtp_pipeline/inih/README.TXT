"inih" is an .ini file parser.  I'm currently using it for the
prototype talker and listener.  It uses a BSD license, which requires
a copyright notification in releases of derived works, but does not
require the source code for derived works to be released.

The description from the project page on Google code:

  inih (INI Not Invented Here) is a simple .INI file parser written in C.
  It's only a couple of pages of code, and it was designed to be small
  and simple, so it's good for embedded systems. It's also more or
  less compatible with Python's ConfigParser style of .INI files,
  including RFC 822-style multi-line syntax and name: value entries.
