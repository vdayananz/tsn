The endpoint process hosts the per-node functionality that's used by
all the talkers/listeners on the node. This includesthe SRP and FQTSS
logic, which is provided by the SRP and FQTSS libraries.

The actual AVTP talkers/listeners are implemented as seperate
processes. Those processes communicate with the endpoint through IPC
(currently we're using a local socket on Linux.)  The IPC
communication is handled by openavb_resv_server.c (server-side IPC,
linked into the endpoint process) and openavb_resv_client.c
(client-side of the IPC, linked into the talker and listener
processes.)
